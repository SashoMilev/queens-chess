# queens-chess
This is a cpp solution to the [8 Queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) but with a custom number of queens (up to 16) on a progressively larger chessboard. The goal is to print the number of possible solutions for the given configuration. The program also includes parallelization of the code using MPI so that it can be executed on multiple cores and run times faster.
