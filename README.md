# queens-chess
This is a cpp solution to the [8 Queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) but with a custom number of queens (up to 16) on a same size chessboard. It prints the number of possible solutions for the given configuration. It also includes a parallelization of the code so that it can be executed on multiple cores and execute much faster.
